# AI-Based Music Player

This project is an AI-powered music player that leverages the Spotify API for music recommendations and OpenAI for personalized playlist generation. It was developed as part of the hackathon at [Hackathon Name/Location], with the goal of providing a unique and personalized music experience for users.

## Features

- **Spotify Integration**: Fetches music recommendations based on the user's preferences.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Generates personalized playlists based on user input and preferences.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Simple, responsive design for seamless music exploration and playback.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: None (uses Spotify API for data)
- **APIs**: 
  - Spotify API
  - OpenAI API
- **Authentication**: OAuth (for Spotify login)
- **Hosting/Cloud**: [mention any cloud platforms used for hosting, like Heroku, Vercel, etc.]
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
